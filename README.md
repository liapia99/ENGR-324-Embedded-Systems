# ENGR324-Embedded-Systems

Introduction to modern real-time embedded systems applications and software
development. Principles of embedded microprocessor architecture, programming,
hardware I/O modules, and network connectivity. Design and optimize in terms of low-
power systems with hardware, software, sensors, actuators, controllers, security, and
networking performance. Hands-on embedded architecture designed with rapid
prototyping. 

## Learning Objectives
1. Design hardware and software of real-time
embedded microcontroller-based systems Labs and projects
2. Design and program micro-controllers in C
/ C++ Labs and projects
3. Designed and implement programmable
Timers for scheduling and timing various
interface tasks
Labs and projects
4. Program analog I/O interfaces and design
advanced I/O interfaces when only a
limited number of I/O ports are available.
